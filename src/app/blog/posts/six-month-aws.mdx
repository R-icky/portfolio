When I started my journey with AWS six months ago, I was stepping into entirely new territory. Like many, I’d heard about the power of the cloud and the vast suite of services AWS offers, but I was coming in with zero hands-on experience. Looking back, it’s astonishing to see how much growth and transformation can happen in just a few months—and how Amazon’s core principles have shaped the way I’ve approached learning and building on AWS.

##Tackling a Data Processing Challenge: Customer Obsession in Action

One of my first projects involved working with a massive dataset that my team had been analyzing manually. The process was labor-intensive and time-consuming. Seeing this, I couldn’t help but think, “There has to be a better way.” Driven by the principle of Customer Obsession, I proactively explored options for automating the task.

After some trial and error, I built a solution that cut down the manual workload by 95%. It wasn’t just about automating tasks—it was about freeing up my team’s time so they could focus on more strategic initiatives. The impact of automation was immediate, and seeing the results only fueled my desire to dive deeper into AWS.

## From Novice to Builder: Bias for Action and Learn and Be Curious
When I joined, I had never used AWS before. But I knew I had to ramp up quickly to deliver value, so I decided to pursue the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification as my first step. This certification gave me the foundational knowledge I needed to navigate AWS with confidence. Within two months, I was able to build a small, end-to-end service—an accomplishment that felt like a significant milestone.

This journey has been a testament to the power of Bias for Action and Learn and Be Curious. AWS’s platform has so much depth and breadth, and there’s always something new to explore. Every day is an opportunity to learn a new tool, a new service, or a new best practice.

## Thinking Big and Insisting on High Standards

AWS operates at a massive scale, and when you’re building on this platform, you have to think about scalability, efficiency, and security from the start. The sheer volume of resources AWS provides can be both exciting and overwhelming, and it’s essential to insist on the highest standards in every aspect of development.

Learning to Think Big has meant not only focusing on immediate goals but also considering how a service or automation might scale. For example, with automation, it’s one thing to solve the problem at hand, but it’s another to build a solution that could scale effortlessly if our data volume grows tenfold. This experience taught me the value of balancing short-term wins with long-term vision.

## Looking Ahead

These six months have been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m excited to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can do with AWS. This journey isn’t just about gaining technical skills; it’s about embodying the principles that make AWS—and the broader tech community—innovative and impactful.
