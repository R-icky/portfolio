## Overview

In this project, I developed the Cryptographic Project — Hash Generator to enhance data security through the implementation of a unique hashing algorithm. Initially, I studied established hashing functions like MD5 and SHA-256 to understand their logic and algorithms. This foundational knowledge paved the way for designing a custom hashing function tailored to meet specific security needs.
The primary objective was to implement a unique hashing function in C, ensuring that sensitive data could be securely transformed and stored. The Hash Generator serves not only as a secure means of data management but also as a learning experience in cryptographic principles and programming techniques.

## Key Features

- Custom Hashing Algorithm: Built a unique hashing function that combines principles learned from MD5 and SHA-256, ensuring robustness against common vulnerabilities.
- Data Integrity Verification: The tool includes mechanisms for checking data integrity, allowing users to detect any unauthorized changes to the original data.
- Configurable Security Parameters: Users can adjust various parameters to customize the hashing process according to their specific security requirements.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Understanding Established Algorithms: Learning the intricacies of MD5 and SHA-256 was challenging but essential for designing a new algorithm. This required deep dives into cryptographic literature and hands-on experimentation.

- Creating a Unique Hash Function: Designing a new hashing algorithm that maintains security while being efficient was a complex task. Balancing speed and complexity taught valuable lessons about algorithm design and optimization.

- Addressing Security Concerns: Ensuring that the new hash function mitigated risks such as collisions and pre-image attacks required extensive testing and validation.

- Input Validation: Implementing robust input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows emphasized the importance of secure coding practices.

## Outcome

The Hash Generator successfully achieved its goal of providing a secure and reliable hashing solution. By integrating lessons from established hashing algorithms and implementing a unique design, the project demonstrated both technical skill and creativity in cryptography. The tool not only enhances data security but also serves as a significant educational resource, laying the groundwork for future developments in cryptographic solutions. Opportunities for further enhancement include exploring advanced features like salting and user authentication to bolster security even more.
